# The Healing Holly (Holistic Healing Website)

This project is a website designed for a client with a holistic healing business, which consists of four pages. 

On the home page it briefly explains a little about her and her ethos. 

On the treatment page, it goes in to more detail about treatments and prices.

The photo section is incomplete, as client not fully set up and not enough images.

There is also a contact page for clients to contact Holly for further information.
 
## UX

This website is designed for a client with a holistic therapies business. They want a website that is easy to use and focus on showing prices as well as information about each therapy.

I will create a website that is intuitive and informative. there will also be aform section where potential clients can email for more information.


## Features

There are four pages to this project.

Home page, where the logo is featured and a brief about section introducing Holly and her business

Treatments page, where potential clients can have a look at what therapies are on offer, and how much they cost.

Photos page, where clients can have a look at the space that they would be treated in.

Contact page, where users can enter their name, email and some info about the specific treatment they are interested in. Holly can then contact them with a follow up email.
